				Game Review (VALORANT)
				</h1>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Brief Summary</strong></p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>What do would you get if Overwatch and Counter-Strike Global Offensive had an offspring, my answer would be VALORANT. The classic aspect of bomb-defuse game mode, Omen&rsquo;s Shrouded Step (Teleport) similar to Overwatch Reaper&rsquo;s Shadow Step and many similarities of agents&rsquo; abilities supports my answer. However, VALORANT has added in (and reworked) many new agents with abilities that is unique to its own title; An example is Yoru, who recently got reworked and one of his abilities, Fakeout, is to send a fake player model in the direction. If enemies shoot this model, it causes a flash.</p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Character (Agents)</strong></p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>In the current patch (5.06), there are 19 agents to play in the game itself. Though it may be very confusing to new players of what to play as, agents themselves are categorized into 4 different types; Sentinels, supports from the back; Initiators, commences a push into a contested area; Controllers, locks down sites with abilities to win the round and finally duelists, securing kills. With these types, players can comfortably explore which agents they connect with and support the team with their abilities.<br>&nbsp;With that said, new players are given 5 agents to play with and they need to earn XP by playing the game to unlock the remaining 14.</p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Maps</strong></p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Maps in VALORANT varies, from Haven&rsquo;s simple 3-bombsites to Split&rsquo;s classic 2-bombsite style, attackers can plan which site to take ahold of whilst defenders&rsquo; setup their defenses to prevent attackers from pushing into a site. Though, the one thing I dislike, is the inability to pick the map that you want to play. This makes new players get disoriented at times due to matchmaking into multiple different maps and the player might get put off by it. However, this implementation of random maps does force players to sometimes play a different agent that would best suit for the map, which results in exploration and experiencing a new way of combat.</p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Weapons</strong></p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Categorized from Pistols to Light Machine Guns, players have the ability to buy any weapons in the store despite which teams they are from provided that they have sufficient credits. The wide variety of weapons allow the players to explore ways to counter their enemy&rsquo;s loadout; For example, if the enemies are on an &ldquo;Eco-Round (pistols only for the sake of saving credits to buy next round)&rdquo;, players may choose to buy Sub-Machine Guns to rush the enemies.</p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Community (Art, Game)</strong></p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Recently VALORANT made a collaboration with Webtoon to commemorate the new Agent, Fade, and their VCT Champion Tournament in Istanbul, Turkey (T&uuml;rkiye); hosting a Webtoon/Art Contest that showcased Fade or the Valorant Agents capturing Fade in Istanbul. With over 350 submissions and 170 thousand views, showcasing the talented artists and lets people be inspired by it to make more.</p>
				<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>However, with every competitive game, comes with its dark part of the community, the toxicity by players whom might take out their anger or frustration by calling people out when they aren&rsquo;t playing well, making the game not fun for players who just wants to play it to wind down from their 9-5 jobs.<br>&nbsp;Though what we can do as a player can only condemn the negative attitude and tell them to enjoy the game rather than solely just winning, efforts being little but it helps a long way eventually.</p>
